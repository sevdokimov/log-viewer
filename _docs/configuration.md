Configuration is located in `log-viewer-1.0.4/config.conf`, the file has [HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config)

### List of available log files

A list of available log files are defined in `logs = [ ... ]` section of the configuration file. The default configuration
gives access to all files with ".log" extension:
```hocon
logs = [
  {
    path: "**/*.log"
  }
]
```

you can replace the default configuration with a more accurate configuration like

```hocon
logs = [
  {
    path: ${HOME}"/one-app/logs/*.log"
  },
  {
    path: ${HOME}"/second-app/logs/*.log"
  },
  {
    path: "/var/log/syslog"
  }
]
```

Each `{ path: "..." }` section opens access to log files by a pattern. The pattern supports wildcards "*" matches a sequence
of any characters except "/", "**" matches a sequence of any characters include "/".<br>
${HOME} will be replaced with the environment variable "HOME", it is a feature of [HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config#uses-of-substitutions).

### Authentication
Basic authentication may be configured. The list of users can be defined in `users = [...]` section.
Passwords can be defined as plain text or as MD5 checksum. 
Example:
```
authentication.enabled = true

users = [
  { 
      name: "user1", 
      password: "1" 
  },
  { 
      name: "user2", 
      password-md5: "c81e728d9d4c2f636f067f89cc14862c" // The password is "2". Specified as md5 hash of "2" string.
  } 
]

```

### Network
`log-viewer.server.port` property specifies the port

`log-viewer.server.interface` allow to specify the network interface to bind the web UI. Setting `log-viewer.server.interface=localhost` will disable non-local connections.  

### Shortcuts
Full file paths don't look good in the URL parameters. You can specify a shortcut for one or several log files in `log-paths` section<br>
Example:

```
log-paths = {
    zzz = {
        file = [${HOME}"/my-app/logs/my-app.log", ${HOME}"/aother-app/logs/aother-app.log"]
    }
}
```

When user opens `http://localhost:8111/log?log=zzz`, he will see the events from `my-app.log` and `aother-app.log` on one page.

You can specify the logs located on other nodes as well:
```
log-paths = {
    zzz = {
        file = ${HOME}"/my-app/logs/my-app.log"
        host = ["node-cn-01", "node-cn-02", "node-cn-03"]
    }
}
```
`http://localhost:8111/log?log=zzz` page will show events from `my-app.log` files located on the 3 remote nodes.<br>
Note: `node-cn-01`, `node-cn-02` and `node-cn-03` must have running Log-Viewer instances.

### Log format

LogViewer detects the format of log files automatically. If the format cannot be detected automatically or if you want to specify
the format more detailed, you can add `format` section beside `path` definition.

In the following example all files with ".log" extension in `${HOME}"/my-app/logs` directory will be parsed as Log4J generated logs
with pattern `%date{yyyy-MM-dd_HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{35} - %msg%n`  
```hocon
logs = [
  {
    path: ${HOME}"/my-app/logs/*.log"

    format = {
      type: Log4jLogFormat
      pattern: "%date{yyyy-MM-dd_HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{35} - %msg%n"       
    }
  }
]
```

`format` property contains an object that defines a log format. The object must contain `type` property. Other properties
depend on format type. The configuration supports the following format types:

###### Log4J format

Log file has been generated by [Log4J](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html)

```hocon
format = {
  type: Log4jLogFormat
  pattern: "%date{yyyy-MM-dd_HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{35} - %msg%n"
  charset: UTF-8       
}  
```
`pattern` - Format of log lines defined the same way as in [Log4j configuration](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/layouts.html#PatternLayout) <br>
`charset` - _(optional)_ file encoding name 

###### Logback format

Log file has been generated by [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch/)

```hocon    
format = {
  type: LogbackLogFormat
  pattern: "%date{yyyy-MM-dd_HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{35} - %msg%n"
  charset: UTF-8       
}
```                      
`pattern` - Format of log lines defined the same way as in [Logback configuration](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html) <br>
`charset` - _(optional)_ file encoding name 

###### Regex format

Log format can be defined with [regular expression](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html).
The log parser applies the regex to each line in the log. If a line matches regex, it is a log event,
if not, the line will be appended to a log event above the line.

```hocon    
format = {
  type: RegexLogFormat
  regex: "(?<date>\\d{4}-\\d\\d-\\d\\d_\\d\\d:\\d\\d:\\d\\d\\.\\d{3}) +(?<level>[A-Z]+) +(?<logger>[\\p{javaJavaIdentifierPart}.]+) +- (?<msg>.+)"
  charset: UTF-8
  fields: [
    { name: "date", type: "date" },
    { name: "level", type: "level/log4j" },
    { name: "logger", type: "class" },
    { name: "msg", type: "message" },
  ]
}
```                      

`regex` - a regex applying to each line

`fields` - list of log fields. Each field description has `name` and `type`. Regex must contain
[named capturing groups](https://www.logicbig.com/tutorials/core-java-tutorial/java-regular-expressions/named-captruing-groups.html)
for each field name. `type` is optional, list of available types is [here](to_be_done).
 
`charset` - _(optional)_ file encoding name
